## What a job
First of all, I am, thankfully, not a philosopher. I would probably have made a very poor one, especially as I can't imagine how one might make a living out of it, except, for most philosophers who stay in the business, by learning it and then teaching it. Clearly, though, humanity has managed to sustain philosophical thought through all sorts of challenges, be they economic or ideological. Philosophy has challenged engrained assumptions, created new ones, themselves to be challenged, and spawned the scientific method, amongst other things. Everyone has heard of Aristotle and Plato from the ancients. Many have at least heard of Hannah Arendt or Martin Heidegger, so philosophy has its rock stars. 

I'm just not one of them, that's all. And that's fine! There is room for overly keen amateurs like me to peer into that rabbit hole and think: "That looks interesting."

## Did somebody bring the map?
As an interested and still enthusiastic amateur, I can say that philosophy is a foreign land that looks… intriguing. It is also immeasurably huge. So, let’s treat this post as an early entry into a travel journal. I have by now read some of the simpler travel guides, started to learn a few words from a phrasebook and had a look at it all online.


## Papers, please
Staying with the foreign travel analogy (said travel being at this time a largely theoretical concept), I could start to ask the basic questions: Am I brave enough? Have I the right credentials? Let’s see what I can rustle together at this juncture:
- Curiosity. Yes, I’m curious about it all. I’m also uncertain about…
- what it is we do, as engineers
- what, exactly, engineering is
- Openness. Hmm, although I’m posting this on the internet, I’m not ready to flag it. So, not really, not yet.
  - I would also say that I’m embarrassed, without evidence that I should be, at the thought that work colleagues might read this and think I’m an idiot for even trying.
>   - I don’t feel ready to enter in a dialogue with others about philosophy
- An engineering degree, and a couple of decades of experience in the field
- I’ve now read a few books and texts on philosophy
- I sometimes try to reflect on my (work) experiences
- I’ve started trying to convert my loose thoughts and observations into writing

Is that enough? It looks like a start, at least. Let’s go!

Did someone bring the map?

## *All* of philosophy?
Just engineering

## Where it all didn’t begin
The only previous encounter I had with philosophy that I can recall is reading Sophie’s World once in my late teens. I think Dad had picked it up on a business trip and passed it on to me. I’m sure I found it interesting, and I read it to the end, but I fear I read it “wrong” in two ways: firstly, in expecting to end up "knowing" more by the time I'd finished. I don’t believe I was open to any possibility of the book granting profound insights into life. If the book contained any notion about philosophy being a journey, a way, rather than being a "thing", or an "action", it was lost on me. Secondly, and strongly linked to the first, I read Sophie’s World wrong because philosophy seemed to run counter to my upbringing under the auspices of religion: I didn’t feel as if philosophy was really “allowed,” and any questions philosophy might have raised were already “answered.”

And that, pretty much, was that between philosophy and me for the next couple of decades.

## Daunt you go there
Philosophers, as far as I knew, practically lived for unnecessarily complicated words like ontology, epistemology and so on. They seemed only able to express things in such tortured and obtuse language that nobody could understand it, other than other professional philosophers.

And how did they get paid for that stuff, anyway? What were they *producing*?

When it wasn't being incomprehensible, philosophy was also being just downright silly.

Examples like the shadow play of Plato's [Allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave), also mentioned, as I recall, in Sophie's World, just seemed to cast philosophy as a somewhat daft thought experiment without any practical use on how to act, to live my life or, eventually, how to study or think about engineering. Not a hint of it.

## Finding my bearings
It took a long while for the “spark” of an offhand comment from a friend of ours a few years ago to light. There were little puffs of hope with earlier attempts at a blog, but they didn’t offer any focus on anything other than, potentially, all of engineering and my part in it.

Now, though, having decided to concentrate on the philosophy of and surrounding engineering, I'm more open to the suggestion that philosophy can offer insights into a possible “meaning of engineering-if-not-life-itself.” Especially as religion didn’t have all that much to say about engineering ("Do unto steel as you would have steel do unto you" wouldn't get us very far, and that bit about us humans having dominion over everything else seems a little... unsettling these days?), whereas philosophy actually does.

## Go on, then, get to the point
The point that I am slowly uncovering is that there isn’t a point. It’s a whole plane, if not more. Philosophy is a way of trying to capture those permanently evanescent, ineffable, internal processes that guide us, in multiple aspects. It provided us with the concept of logic, but it doesn’t tend to provide algorithms.

As far as I understand it now, philosophy is more a way of reflection than psychological analysis, though it enables that spectrum between feelings and notions on the one hand, and deep science on the other; we could almost say it’s a way of life, but it doesn’t prescribe what that way, for you, should be. Knowing the difference between techne and phronesis, for example, or considering hermeneutics as entering a dialogue with the author, even behind the screen of an apparently “done” text, might help to condition how we work.

Aristotle’s notion of “praxis”, or practice, as being how we act towards the commonly understood “good” of a community (and its politics) can also be a guiding thought – but also a rabbit hole of understanding which community we are actually serving.

We can treat the “names” of philosophy (Aristotle, Plato, Newman, Arendt, Gadamer, Husserl, etc) as the high priests of such thinking. Essentially, they’re the 'pros' who (somehow) managed to finance a life of thought and teaching for the rest of humanity. The problem with pros in any area of life, be it sport or art or materials science, is that their achievements can appear unattainable for mere mortals. This is what I’m trying to do here – not to attain the same level of mastery as those names, but to condense and learn from them as I apply it to my / our world of engineering.

As Seneca mentioned; our own lives may be short, but they're not disconnected from the mass of human experience that has gone before - we can contemplate their thinking, and others' interpretations and "takes" on their thinking and try to map out our own field of experience, of life, and how to live it: what we do, and how.

This field is also one of tension, containing knowledge, being and becoming, interpretation and understanding, agency and ethics, to name a few of the major points.

## What questions could I be asking?
I’m glad I asked the question! It’s a good way of analysing my enjoyment and frustrations around the business of engineering: the latter reflecting more the “non-value-add” aspects of what we do, that are eminently justified, but can end up becoming overwhelming. Questions would be along the lines of:
•	How much audit is too much audit? Can there be too little?
•	Timing plans: what do they mean, really?
•	Of course we need to validate our products: but who enjoys it?

## The point of the point being?
To put it concisely (this being the first attempt at describing why I’m doing this):

> To help myself - and, potentially, others - to reflect on what it is we put ourselves through as engineers, and why. Searching for connections between nature, our nature, our communities, society and humanity – and our jobs. To reflect and, perhaps, even, to understand.

Fundamentally, philosophy is concerned with doing good by the community. We as engineers are associated with many communities, and it’s up to us to reflect on how deep and wide the goodness of our actions is transmitted.
