        #Welcome to Onto Engineering from the Existential Engineer
        Philosophy and engineering: oil and water. They can sit in parallel to each other, never really interacting ![Oil and water](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8mb3rfiybll6ni/OilAndWater.png?dl=0).
        If someone is willing to energetically stir things up, we can create an emulsion [2nd sketch, image]. Some emulsions are stupendously useful (like paint), others… less so.
        <p>I’m guessing that an engineering-philosophy emulsion will end up on the not-so-useful end of the scale, but for some not really fathomable reason, I’m willing to try. But why...?
