Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be!

Typing is easy. But I want to be able to add images, and GitHub pages via Jekyll isn't letting me do this. I've tried using the kramdown reference guide [^1]
