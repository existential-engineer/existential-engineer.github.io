Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be!

And here's the image I was trying to get from the index.html file via dropbox ![OilAndWater](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8mb3rfiybll6ni/OilAndWater.png?dl=0)

And here it is again from within GitHub ![OilAndWater]({{ site.url }}/_assets/_images/OilAndWater.png)
