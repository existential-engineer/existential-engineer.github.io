Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be!

Typing is easy, and I finally managed to find the right syntax for inserting images (that was a bit of a battle). In the end I used the kramdown reference guide[^1] and the GitHub guide to mastering Markdown[^2]
