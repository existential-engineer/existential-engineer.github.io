        <h1>Welcome to Onto Engineering from the Existential Engineer</h1>
        <h2>Click <a href="/blog/index.html">here for the blog</a> (or on the header tab at the top of the page!)</h2>
        <p>Philosophy and engineering: oil and water. They can sit in parallel to each other, never really interacting: </p> <p> <img src="/images/PhiOnEng@0.5x.png" alt="OilAndWater" /></p>
        <p>Of course, depending on your perspective, the layers might be the other way around: philosophy "supporting" engineering:</p>
        <p><img src="/images/EngOnPhi.png" alt="PhilosophySupportingEngineering" /></p>
        <p>Of course, Philosophy can be viewed as being the basis for - everything:</p>
        <p><img src="/images/ManyOnPhi.png" alt="PhilosophyBasisEverything" /></p>
        <p>Now, if someone is willing to add some energy into the system, and some additional mixing agents, like ideas, then stir things up, we can create an emulsion: <p> <img src="/images/MixedEmulsions.png" alt="Philosophy_Engineering_MixedEmulsions" /></p>
        <p>Some emulsions are stupendously useful (like paint), others… less so.</p>
        <p>I’m guessing that an engineering-philosophy emulsion will end up on the not-so-useful end of the scale, but for some not really fathomable reason, I’m willing to try. <a href="/about">But why...?</a></p>
        <p>There's the old adage (with a million variations) that an engineer needs a philosopher like a bird needs an aerodynamicist. The bird will fly regardless - but perhaps we, if not the bird, can learn something along the way.</p>
