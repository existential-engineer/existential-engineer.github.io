        <h1>Welcome to Onto Engineering from the Existential Engineer</h1>
        <p>Philosophy and engineering: oil and water. They can sit in parallel to each other, never really interacting <img src="https://github.com/existential-engineer/existential-engineer.github.io/blob/master/_assets/_images/OilAndWater.png" alt="OilAndWater">.</p>
        <p>If someone is willing to energetically stir things up, we can create an emulsion [2nd sketch, image]. Some emulsions are stupendously useful (like paint), others… less so.</p>
        <p>I’m guessing that an engineering-philosophy emulsion will end up on the not-so-useful end of the scale, but for some not really fathomable reason, I’m willing to try. <a href="/about">But why...?</a></p>
