        <h1>Welcome to Onto Engineering from the Existential Engineer</h1>
        <p>Philosophy and engineering: oil and water. They can sit in parallel to each other, never really interacting </p> <p> <img src="/images/OilAndWater.png" alt="OilAndWater" />.</p>
        <p>Of course, depending on your perspective, the layers might be the other way around: philosophy "supporting" engineering, providing the basis of our enterprise - and many others.</p>

        <p>Now, if someone is willing to add some energy into the system, and some additional mixing agents, like ideas, then stir things up, we can create an emulsion [2nd sketch, image]. Some emulsions are stupendously useful (like paint), others… less so.</p>
        <p>I’m guessing that an engineering-philosophy emulsion will end up on the not-so-useful end of the scale, but for some not really fathomable reason, I’m willing to try. <a href="/about">But why...?</a></p>
